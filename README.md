# SimplePlanner
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: CS50x final project - SimplePlanner, a quick and simple diet and activity tracker
#### The goal in the creation of the system was to:
>Allow the tracking of calorific intake and expendature without the headache.

From this general idea, the main goals were to:
>- Simplify tracking the nutritional value of home cooked meals
>- Remove information not needed for the average user of a diet tracking system
>- Give a general awareness of how balanced a user's activity and diet are
>- Avoid going into the weeds around the subject
